                <div class="rec">normal div, as the rec1 division has come out of the HTML flow the positionof the rec1 is taken by this rectangle,
                    <p>the rec1 rectangle has given a position absolute and calculated top value so its been placed inside this section otherswise the rec will float in its current position if values are not provided</p>

                    This is position fixed from Section 4 <br>
                    Position Fixed
                    In this Position it will also leave its current position and come out from the HTML flow, and stay in its assigned position irrespective of scrolling

                You already have seen how its working

                    Here section parent could have any position other than static to make this work

                    Position absolute

                </div>
                <p>
                    the rectangle can be position by giving its parent any position

                <h3>Z Index</h3>
                <p>The 1st element will have lower z-index than its next element so that 1st will be overlapped by 2nd and so on</p>
                <p>We can manually set Z-index to any value to change overlapping</p>
                <p>Because of that Z-index, The fixed floating rectangle is getting overlapped by the section 6 as well as our rainbow</p>
