        <h3>What are partials files in php?</h3>
        <p>A pre-defined code saved in a separate file, which can be included or used in another file can be called as partials</p>
        <h3>How to use partials efficiently?</h3>
        <p>If we know some part of page will be used in all/some webpages as it is, this code can be written as partial & can be used by using include or require methods</p>
        <p>If we know some part of page will be used in all/some webpages as is it, this code can be written as partial & can be used by using include or require methods</p>

        <h2>From Now On we will use partials to keep our code clean & maintain it properly</h2>

        <h1 class="center-text">PHP Database Connection</h1>
        <h3>To connect with database we first need to have database created on our xampp server</h3>
        <p>In folder structure you can see a winterhip.sql file is provided</p>
        <p>Start your xampp server and then import the file in the provided link</p>
        <a href="http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php?route=/server/import" target="_blank">Import Database</a>
        <h3>Function To Connect With Database</h3>
        <p>mysqli_connect() : This function takes 4 arguments which are "servername","username","password","Database name"</p>
        <p>we can declare 4 variables to hold this values or we can simply pass them as the argument to the function</p>
        <p>The value return by the function will be stored in $con variable</p>
        <pre>
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "root";
    $password = "";
    $database = "winternShip";

    }

        echo "Connected";
    }
        </pre>
        <p>This code will be written in php tag to be executed</p>
        <p>If the connection is failed then the die method will be executed otherwise it will print connected</p>
        <p>We use db connection as a partial file in php because we need to connect to database before using any SQL query </p>

                // If the connection is not made, then the further code won't work because of the die() method

        <p>As the server is on and Database is created, Above we can see the database is connected</p>
        <p>Try changing values of php variables for getting error</p>
